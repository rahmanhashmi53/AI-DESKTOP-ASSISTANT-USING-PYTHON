Openai response for prompt: jarvis using artificial intelligence write a python program 
 ****************** 

Of course! Here is a simple Python program that uses artificial intelligence to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and the scikit-learn library:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the MNIST dataset
digits = datasets.load_digits()

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier
clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100,), max_iter=500)

# Train the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f"Accuracy of the classifier: {accuracy}")
```

This program uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. You can run this program in a Python environment to see it in action. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
