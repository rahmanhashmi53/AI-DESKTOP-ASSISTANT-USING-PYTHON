Openai response for prompt: using artificial intelligence write a python program for fibonacci series 
 ****************** 

Certainly! Here is a Python program using artificial intelligence to generate the Fibonacci series:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Please enter a positive integer."
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_series = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            next_number = fib_series[-1] + fib_series[-2]
            fib_series.append(next_number)
        return fib_series

n = int(input("Enter the number of terms for Fibonacci series: "))
result = fibonacci(n)
print("Fibonacci Series:", result)
```

You can run this program in a Python environment to generate the Fibonacci series up to the specified number of terms. Just enter a positive integer when prompted to see the Fibonacci series up to that number of terms.
